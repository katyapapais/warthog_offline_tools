# Extrinsic Calibration Tools
This directory contains tools for performing extrinsic calibration. At the moment, the available calibration is specific to Aeva->Ouster.

## Instructions

Before proceeding with the extrinsic calibration, ensure that the code in the `/cpp` folder is built. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `/cpp` directory:
    ```
    cd cpp
    ```

2. Build the code:
    ```
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

Once the build process is complete, you can use the calibration scripts.

## Notes

- Ensure all dependencies required for building the `/cpp` folder are installed.
